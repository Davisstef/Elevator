# Elevator

### A Simple Elevator App I created at FDM

This app is run from the Elevator/src/main/java/Main.java file ideally through Eclipse.

Once you are on the Main.java file in Eclipse, you can click on the green arrow to run the application.

The elevators should move independently of one another based on the assigned commands in Main.java.
